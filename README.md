# QuaLLM-Health: An Adaptation of an LLM-Based Framework for Quantitative Data Extraction from Online Health Discussions

An Adaptation of an LLM-Based Framework for Quantitative Data Extraction from Online Health Discussions

Overview
QuaLLM-Health is an adaptation of the QualLLM framework, specifically designed to extract clinically relevant quantitative data from unstructured health discussions on social media platforms like Reddit. This project leverages large language models (LLMs) to transform unstructured text into actionable insights, focusing on conversations about glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists.

Contents
code/: Contains Python scripts for data collection, preprocessing, annotation, LLM prompt engineering, and evaluation.
data/
gold_standard_dataset.csv: The annotated gold-standard dataset used for model evaluation.
full_dataset.csv: The complete dataset of Reddit posts and comments related to GLP-1 receptor agonists and cancer discussions.
annotation guideline: Detailed guidelines used by human annotators for data labeling.
